# Home-Brewed-3D-Printer

This Home Brewed 3D printer uses the skeleton of an old tube TV. I have gutted the TV and added supports. The translation system is composed mostly of Open Build's V-slot Linear rail, gantries, and mounts. The Brain of the printer is a BeagleBoneBlack with a Replicape attatchment.
