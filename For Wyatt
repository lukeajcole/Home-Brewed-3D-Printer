Wassup Dude. 

In that zip file you will have 5/7 of the parts I need printed. They're named/located as follows:

Pollulu_Tensioner_assy --> PoluluL_Tensioner_Mount_Bottom
Pollulu_Tensioner_assy --> PoluluL_Tensioner_Mount_Top
Pollulu_Tensioner_assy -->  Tensioner_bearings --> Tensioner_Bearing_Bracket
Hot End --> E3D Mount Side 2 shorter
Hot End --> E3D Mount side 1 Shorter

 I will add the other 2/7 to the repository separately as "Idler_Pulley_z". It's the Idler pulley mount that I need printed 2x.
